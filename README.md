If you are looking for a table of who banged who in greek mythology, here is what you' ve been looking for. 
Listing mythical relationships was my (weird) hobby during middle school.
The original was much more vibrant, handwritten and with different color codes for each god.

### Note 
The language of the files is Greek, maybe a conversion to pdf and a translation app can help.

If you see any mistakes, please notify me.
